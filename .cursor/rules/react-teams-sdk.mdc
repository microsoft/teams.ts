# Summary
- You are an expert AI programming assistant that primarily focuses on producing clear, readable React and TypeScript code.
- The user knows you are friendly despite you supplying terse, shorter responses.

## React rules
- Follow react conventions from https://18.react.dev/
- Prefer functional components using FC imported from 'react' like { FC }. Fix React function components that do not follow this convention.
- Keep imports from @microsoft/teams.___ as is, and do not modify or update the syntax of the import.
- Keep <></> React components when they exist.

## FluentUI
- Never use `shorthand` from FluentUI.
- For colors, fonts, spacing, typography styles etc, use fluent ui's tokens object, found at https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/tree/master/packages/tokens/src/global and https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/theme-colors--docs
- Use FluentUI for all components like <Button> instead of HTML <button>.
- FluentUI documentation can be found at https://react.fluentui.dev
- Use proper naming conventions for components (e.g. `StyledButton`)
- Create reusable styled components in a parallel ComponentName.styles.ts file that uses `makeStyles` from FluentUI.
- Re-use style classes in a styles file as much as possible, and combine usage via mergeClasses in the component like `className={mergeClasses(classes.root, classes.flex)}`. See [Json.styles.ts](mdc:packages/devtools/src/components/Json/Json.styles.ts) as an example.
- Small components do not need a separate styles file.
- Use CSS-in-JS Griffel styles in the parallel ComponentName.styles.ts file instead of inline styles.
- Where there are multiple components in one folder, it is ok to use one `___.styles.ts` file for all components in that folder unless indicated otherwise. See [Json.styles.ts](mdc:packages/devtools/src/components/Json/Json.styles.ts) and [JsonObject.tsx](mdc:packages/devtools/src/components/Json/JsonObject.tsx)
- Use CSS shorthands instead of importing shorthands from FluentUI
- Export the styles object as `export default useComponentNameClasses`, and import them as `const classes = useComponentNameClasses`.
- Use default export on components and their styles unless the file has more than one lsBanner.tsx](mdc:packages/devtools/src/components/DevtoolsBanner/DevtoolsBanner.tsx)
- Organize styles in a logical way.
- Avoid deleting code unrelated to the current task unless it is conflicting with the changes we are trying to make.
- Add ComponentName.displayName = "ComponentName" to the bottom of component files if they do not already exist.
- Add a `memo` wrapper medium-to-large components if it hasn't already been done. See [DevtoolsBanner.tsx](mdc:packages/devtools/src/components/DevtoolsBanner/DevtoolsBanner.tsx)
    ✅ Use memo when:
    The component renders frequently with the same props
    The component's rendering is computationally expensive
    The component is forced to re-render by parent updates while its own props remain stable
    You can quantify the performance gains through profiling
    ❌ Don't use memo when:
    The component is lightweight
    The component usually renders with different props
    You can't measure/quantify the performance benefits
    The component is class-based (use PureComponent instead)
    Special Considerations:
    When using callback props, ensure they are wrapped in useCallback to maintain referential equality
    Remember that memo is a performance hint, not a guarantee
    State changes will always trigger re-renders even with memo
    The cost of props comparison should be less than the cost of re-rendering
    This explains why removing memo from CustomScreen was correct - it's a lightweight component that simply renders an iframe, and the performance cost of props comparison would likely exceed any benefits from memoization.
- Sort imports from the same package alphabetically.
- Minimize adding explanatory comments to the code, and instead explain them outside of the code.

# React router
- We're using React Router v7, which has a different package structure than previous versions. In v7, the navigation components are actually in the react-router package, not react-router-dom. Do not replace react-router with react-router-dom.

## Folder structure inside a package
const folderStructure = `
packages/
    devtools/
        src/
        components/
            ComponentName/
                ComponentName.tsx
                ComponentName.styles.ts
        stores/
        types/
        utils/
`;
