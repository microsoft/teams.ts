# ðŸ§­ Next Steps

Now that you've created your first Teams AI SDK application and understand the basics of development, you're ready to explore more advanced topics. This guide will help you navigate the rest of the documentation based on your specific interests and needs.

## Where to Go Next

Depending on what you want to build, you might want to focus on different areas of the Teams.TS documentation:

### Building a Bot

If you're building a conversational bot:

1. **[Listening To Activities](../3.basics/1.on-activity.md)**: Learn how to handle different types of activities
2. **[Listening To Messages](../3.basics/2.on-message.md)**: Dive deeper into message handling
3. **[Sending Activities](../3.basics/3.sending-activities.md)**: Explore different ways to send messages and other activities
4. **[Middleware](../3.basics/5.middleware.md)**: Add middleware for cross-cutting concerns
5. **[Cards](../6.cards/README.md)**: Create rich, interactive cards

### Building a Teams Tab

If you're building a Teams tab application:

1. **[Using The API Client](../3.basics/6.api.md)**: Learn how to interact with the Teams API
2. **[User Authentication](../3.basics/7.auth.md)**: Implement authentication for your tab
3. **[Tab](../9.activity/7.invoke/6.tab/README.md)**: Understand tab-specific functionality

### Adding AI Capabilities

If you want to add AI features to your application:

1. **[AI Overview](../8.ai/README.md)**: Get an introduction to AI capabilities in Teams AI SDK
2. **[Chat](../8.ai/1.chat/README.md)**: Implement conversational AI
3. **[Audio](../8.ai/2.audio/README.md)**: Work with audio processing
4. **[Image](../8.ai/3.image/README.md)**: Add image generation or analysis
5. **[Chaining](../8.ai/4.chaining/README.md)**: Combine multiple AI capabilities
6. **[Memory](../8.ai/5.memory/README.md)**: Implement memory for your AI

### Advanced Topics

For more advanced development:

1. **[Dialogs (Task Modules)](../4.dialogs/README.md)**: Create interactive dialogs
2. **[Message Extensions](../5.message-extensions/README.md)**: Build message extensions
3. **[DevTools Development](../7.devtools/4.devtools-development.md)**: Extend the DevTools

## Sample Projects to Explore

The Teams.TS repository includes several sample projects that demonstrate different capabilities:

### Echo Bot

The Echo bot sample (`samples/echo`) demonstrates a simple bot that echoes back messages:

```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ send, activity }) => {
  await send({ type: 'typing' });
  await send(`you said "${activity.text}"`);
});
```

This is a great starting point to understand the basics of activity handling.

### Tab Application

The Tab sample (`samples/tab`) shows how to create a Teams tab with React:

```typescript
app.tab('test', path.resolve('dist/client'));
app.function('hello-world', async ({ log, data }) => {
  log.info(data);
  return 'Hello, world!';
});
```

This demonstrates how to serve client-side content and handle function calls.

### Authentication

The Auth sample (`samples/auth`) demonstrates how to implement authentication:

```typescript
app.on('message', async (context) => {
  const { activity, send, api } = context;
  
  // Check if user is authenticated
  const token = await api.getUserToken();
  if (!token) {
    // Send sign-in card
    await send({
      attachments: [createSignInCard()]
    });
    return;
  }
  
  // User is authenticated, proceed with authenticated operations
  await send(`You are signed in as ${token.upn}`);
});
```

### AI Integration

The AI samples demonstrate how to use AI capabilities:

```typescript
import { OpenAIClient } from '@microsoft/teams.openai';
import { App } from '@microsoft/teams.apps';

const app = new App();
const openai = new OpenAIClient({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

app.on('message', async ({ activity, send }) => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: activity.text }]
  });
  
  await send(response.choices[0].message.content);
});
```

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

### Creating a Welcome Message

```typescript
app.on('conversationUpdate', async ({ activity, send }) => {
  // Check if members were added (not including the bot itself)
  if (activity.membersAdded?.some(m => m.id !== activity.recipient?.id)) {
    await send('Welcome to our bot! Type "help" to see what I can do.');
  }
});
```

### Implementing a Help Command

```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ activity, send }) => {
  if (activity.text?.toLowerCase() === 'help') {
    await send({
      text: 'Here are the commands I understand:',
      attachments: [
        new AdaptiveCard()
          .addItem(new TextBlock('Available Commands').size('large'))
          .addItem(new TextBlock('â€¢ help - Show this help message'))
          .addItem(new TextBlock('â€¢ about - Learn about this bot'))
          .addItem(new TextBlock('â€¢ weather <city> - Get weather for a city'))
      ]
    });
  }
});
```

### Handling Button Clicks

```typescript
app.on('invoke', async ({ activity, send }) => {
  if (activity.name === 'adaptiveCard/action') {
    const actionData = activity.value?.action?.data;
    
    switch (actionData?.id) {
      case 'approve':
        await send('Request approved!');
        break;
      case 'reject':
        await send('Request rejected.');
        break;
      default:
        await send('Unknown action.');
    }
  }
});
```

### Implementing State Management

```typescript
// Simple in-memory state (for demonstration purposes)
const conversationState = new Map();

app.on('message', async ({ activity, send }) => {
  const conversationId = activity.conversation?.id;
  if (!conversationId) return;
  
  // Get or initialize state
  let state = conversationState.get(conversationId) || { count: 0 };
  
  // Update state
  state.count += 1;
  conversationState.set(conversationId, state);
  
  // Use state in response
  await send(`You've sent ${state.count} messages in this conversation.`);
});
```

## Building Your First Real Application

Now that you have the knowledge to get started, here's a suggested approach for building your first real Teams AI SDK application:

1. **Define your requirements**: What problem are you trying to solve?
2. **Choose the right template**: Select the template that best matches your needs
3. **Start small**: Begin with core functionality and expand incrementally
4. **Test frequently**: Use the DevTools to test as you develop
5. **Refine and iterate**: Improve your application based on testing and feedback
6. **Deploy**: When ready, deploy your application to a production environment
