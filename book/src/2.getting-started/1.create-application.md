Getting Started: Create Application

This guide will walk you through creating your first **Spark** app! By the end you'll have a working application ready for development.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started please ensure you have:

| Name                                       | Version  | Notes |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------- | :---- |
| [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)     | `>= 20`  | Spark.JS requires Node.js version 20 or higher to ensure compatibility with all features |

## Installing the CLI

The Spark CLI provides tools for creating and managing Spark applications.

First install the `@microsoft/spark.cli` globally (recommended):
```sh
npm install -g @microsoft/teams.cli@latest
```

> **Alternative:** If you prefer not to install globally you can use `npx` for each command:
```sh
npx @microsoft/spark.cli new <name> ...
```

After installation you can verify it's working by running:
```sh
spark --version
```

## Creating An Application

The primary command to create a new Spark project is `spark new`:

```sh
teams new <name>
```

Replace `<name>` with the desired name for your project directory. This will create a new directory with that name and scaffold a basic Spark application using the default template.

For example to create a new application called "my-first-spark-app":

```sh
spark new my-first-spark-app
```

### Common Options

You can customize the project creation with these common options:

| Option                 | Description                                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--template <type>`    | Specifies the project template to use (e.g. `echo` `tab` `ai`).          |
| `--ttk <config_name>`  | Includes configuration files compatible with Teams Toolkit.                 |
| `--start`              | Installs dependencies and starts the application immediately after creation. |

*(For a full list of commands and options see the [CLI Reference](<../cli-reference.md>).)* <!-- Link to future page -->

You can combine multiple options. For example to create an echo bot application and start it immediately:

```sh
spark new my-echo-app --template echo --start
```

### Option Details & Examples

#### `--template <type>`

This option lets you choose a starting point for your application.

*   **Purpose:** Selects a pre-defined structure and set of files.
*   **Available Templates:**

    | Template | Description | Use Case |
    | :------- | :---------- | :------- |
    | `echo` | A simple echo bot that responds to messages | Getting started with bot development |
    | `tab` | A Teams tab application with React | Building Teams tab experiences |
    | `ai` | A bot with AI capabilities using Spark.AI | Creating intelligent conversational experiences |
    | `graph` | An application with Microsoft Graph integration | Accessing Microsoft 365 data and services |
    | `mcp` | A Model Context Protocol server template | Building custom MCP servers for AI integration |

*   **Example:** Create a project named `my-echo-bot` using the `echo` template:
    ```sh
    spark new my-echo-bot --template echo
    ```

    This creates a simple bot that echoes back any message it receives providing a great starting point for learning the basics of Spark.JS.

#### `--ttk <config_name>`

Integrates configuration files recognized by the Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension for VS Code.

*   **Purpose:** Facilitates local development and debugging using Teams Toolkit features.
*   **`<config_name>`:** Typically refers to an environment name (e.g. `development` `local`). The CLI will generate corresponding `.env` files and potentially update `teamsapp.yml`.
*   **Example:** Create `my-ttk-app` with Teams Toolkit config for the `local` environment:
    ```sh
    spark new my-ttk-app --ttk local
    ```

    This is particularly useful if you're already familiar with Teams Toolkit or plan to use its debugging and deployment features.

#### `--start`

Installs project dependencies (`npm install`) and attempts to start the application (`npm start` or similar) right after the files are created.

*   **Purpose:** Quickly get the application running after scaffolding.
*   **Example:** Create `my-quick-app` using the default template and start it immediately:
    ```sh
    spark new my-quick-app --start
    ```

    This is a great option when you want to see your application running right away without additional commands.

## What Happens During Creation

When you run the `spark new` command the CLI:

1. Creates a new directory with your specified name
2. Copies the template files into the directory
3. Updates package.json with your project name
4. If `--start` is specified:
   - Installs dependencies (`npm install`)
   - Starts the application (`npm start`)

## What's Next?

After creating your application:

1. **Explore the project structure** to understand the files and directories created
2. **Run your application** locally to see it in action
3. **Add functionality** by implementing activity handlers cards or other features

Check out the next guide on [Project Structure](./2.project-structure.md) to learn more about the files and directories in your new Spark application.
