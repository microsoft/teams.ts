# üëã Welcome to Spark.JS

Spark.JS is a modern, flexible SDK that empowers developers to build powerful applications, bots, and AI agents for Microsoft Teams with less code and fewer dependencies. It provides a cohesive set of tools and abstractions that work together seamlessly, allowing you to focus on creating intelligent and effective solutions rather than managing complex configurations and boilerplate code.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üß© Streamlined Development** - Minimize boilerplate code and reduce setup complexity
- **üîÑ Unified Tooling** - A cohesive suite that consolidates functionality previously spread across multiple libraries
- **ü§ñ AI-Native Abstractions** - Built-in support for integrating AI capabilities into your Teams applications
- **üõ†Ô∏è Integrated Developer Tools** - Local development, debugging, and testing tools built right in
- **üì¶ Low Dependency** - Designed for longevity with minimal external dependencies
- **üîå Flexible & Unopinionated** - Provides tools and abstractions without dictating application architecture

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running with a new Spark.JS application in just three steps:

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
npm install -g @microsoft/spark.cli@latest

# 2. Create a new project
spark new my-teams-app --start

# 3. Open your browser
# The app is now running at http://localhost:3978
```

That's it! Your application is now running locally. For more detailed instructions, check out the [Getting Started](../2.getting-started/README.md) guide.
