# Environments

The Teams CLI provides tools for managing environment variables that can be exported to a `.env` file. This page explains how to use the `env` command to manage your environment variables.

## Overview

The Teams CLI's `env` command helps you:

- List and manage environment variables
- Set and remove environment variables
- Export variables to a `.env` file

## Available Commands

Here are the available environment management commands:

```sh
teams env list               # List environments (alias: ls)
teams env select <name>      # Select an environment
teams env set <key> [value]  # Set an environment key
teams env del <key>          # Delete an environment key
teams env export [name]      # Export an environment to a .env file in your current working directory
```

### Listing Environment Variables

To see all environment variables:

```sh
teams env list
# or
teams env ls
```

### Managing Environment Variables

To set an environment variable:

```sh
teams env set <key> [value]
```

To remove an environment variable:

```sh
teams env del <key>
```

### Exporting Environment Variables

To export environment variables to a `.env` file in your current working directory:

```sh
teams env export [name]
```

> Note that selecting an environment in the CLI does not automatically add it to your app. You have to manually export it to create the `.env` file.
