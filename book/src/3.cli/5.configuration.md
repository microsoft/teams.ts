# Configuration

The Teams CLI provides tools for configuring your Teams applications through the `config` command. This page explains how to use this command to add and remove configurations from your projects.

## Configuration Overview

The `config` command allows you to add or remove specific configurations to your Teams application. These configurations can include:
  
- Teams Toolkit integrations

Adding a configuration involves adding scaffolding files and updating project metadata, such as package.json.

## Using the Config Command

The `config` command has two main subcommands:

- `add`: Add a configuration to your project
- `remove`: Remove a configuration from your project

### Adding Configurations

To add a configuration to your project:

```sh
teams config add <configuration-name>
```

For example, to add Teams Toolkit configuration for basic development:

```sh
teams config add ttk.basic
```

### Removing Configurations

To remove a configuration from your project:

```sh
teams config remove <configuration-name>
```

For example, to remove Teams Toolkit Basic configuration:

```sh
teams config remove ttk.basic
```

This will delete files added by the configuration and undo changes made to other metadata files, such as `package.json`.

## Available Configurations

### Teams Toolkit Integration

The Teams Toolkit configuration (`ttk`) adds the necessary files and settings to make your application compatible with the [Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

#### Adding Teams Toolkit Configuration

```sh
teams config add ttk.<setting>
```

Where `<setting>` can be:
- `basic`: For basic bot development in Teams.
- `embed`: For apps that will embed tabs int Teams.
- `oauth`: `basic` configuration along with user authentication.

For example:

```sh
teams config add ttk.basic
```

> Only one of these configurations should be applied to the project otherwise it can lead to undefined behavior.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Dependencies

If you see errors about missing dependencies after adding a configuration:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install any new dependencies added by the configuration.

### Invalid Configuration

If a configuration is invalid or corrupted:

1. Remove the configuration:
   ```sh
   teams config remove <configuration-name>
   ```

2. Re-add the configuration:
   ```sh
   teams config add <configuration-name>
   ```
