# Installation

This guide provides detailed instructions for installing and setting up the Teams CLI (`@microsoft/teams.cli`).

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Teams CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

| Name                                       | Version  | Notes |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------- | :---- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)  | `>= 20`  | Teams.TS requires Node.js version 20 or higher |
| npm                                        | `>= 9`   | Included with Node.js |

## Installation Options

There are several ways to install and use the Teams CLI:

### 1. Global Installation (Recommended)

Installing the CLI globally makes it available as a command from any directory on your system:

```sh
npm install -g @microsoft/teams.cli@latest
```

After installation, you can verify it's working by running:

```sh
teams --version
```

This should display the current version of the Teams CLI.

### 2. Project-Specific Installation

You can also install the CLI as a development dependency in your project:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @microsoft/teams.cli
```

When installed this way, you can run the CLI using npx:

```sh
npx teams <command>
```

Or add it to your package.json scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "create-app": "teams new my-app --template echo"
  }
}
```

### 3. Using npx Without Installation

You can use the CLI without installing it by using npx:

```sh
npx @microsoft/teams.cli@latest <command>
```

This will download and execute the latest version of the CLI for the specific command.

## Updating the CLI

To update a globally installed CLI to the latest version:

```sh
npm update -g @microsoft/teams.cli
```

Or reinstall it:

```sh
npm uninstall -g @microsoft/teams.cli
npm install -g @microsoft/teams.cli@latest
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors when installing globally, you may need to use sudo (on Linux/macOS):

```sh
sudo npm install -g @microsoft/teams.cli@latest
```

Alternatively, you can [configure npm to use a different directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).

### Version Conflicts

If you have multiple versions installed or are experiencing unexpected behavior:

1. Check the installed version:
   ```sh
   teams --version
   ```

2. Ensure you're using the correct version:
   ```sh
   which teams  # On Linux/macOS
   where teams  # On Windows
   ```

3. If needed, reinstall the CLI as described in the updating section.
